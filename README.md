# Melon Reservation Scheduler

## Description
This project allows you to make and manage melon tasting reservations. üçâ

## Justification
I chose to use Flask because it is a lightweight web framework that is flexible and simple to implement. 
I used postgreSQL because it's a commonly used relational database and makes a good choice since every reservation has a consistent format.
SQLAlchemy allowed me to incorporate these two technologies using Python. 
On the front end, I built this page in React as a single page app because client side rendering provides a more seamless experience for the user.
